# Simpsons Quote Terminal
> Random quote generator connecting to a Simpsons quote API made to look like a Ubuntu terminal. Live demo available at https://jaredcaraway.github.io/simpsons-quote-terminal/.

This is a browser-based app I originally created while going through the freeCodeCamp curriculum. Simpsons quotes are delivered via [Jason Luboff's Simpsons Quote API](https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me).

## How to Use

This app is incredibly simple! 

1. Pull up the live demo. 
2. To generate a quote, you simply click on the icon that says (wait for it!) "Generate Quote." The API server seems to shut down if it's not pinged for a while, so you may have to try a couple of times before you get a quote response.
3. Once the quote is displayed, a "Tweet Quote" button appears which allows you to - that's right! - tweet the quote.
